## I previously used biomaRt for this but the results are were not great
## When I manually checked the gene lists associated with particular GO terms
## Many genes were missing for most terms
## Instead, I have downloaded a static copy of the GO annotations from amiGO
## This is more up to date and seems to work better
## Leaving this old code for biomaRt commented out here in case we need in the future

# library("biomaRt")
# ensembl <- useMart("ensembl",dataset="hsapiens_gene_ensembl")
